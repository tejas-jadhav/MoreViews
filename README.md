# MoreViews

The aim of this project is to get more familiarized with the variety of views available in android. 
I am also trying to organize my code properly into packages and classes. This app does not uses any API
or Database so nothing is persistent. 

Different Views that I used here: 
- ViewPager2
- BottomNavigationView
- RecyclerView (with multiple ViewHolders)
- Spinners
- RangeSlider
- ActionBar menus

I learnt many things while creating this app out of my own Imagination.

### Things I did:
1. Creating an Data size converter Fragment
1. Making Views Clickable and adding ripples
1. Creating drawables to add custom shape/effect 
1. Converting view into a bitmap (using Canvas) 
1. Sharing an image using inbuilt intent
1. Validating form input
